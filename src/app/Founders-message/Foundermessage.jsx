          <p>
            I was born into an oil & gas family—nearly every member of my extended family worked in the energy sector.
            From early childhood, I was immersed in the language of contracts, the culture of projects, and the rhythms of negotiation.
            I didn’t just study this industry—I grew up in it.
          </p>

          <p>
            That lifelong immersion shaped how I think, negotiate, and guide our clients today. After years of working at the heart of Iran’s energy sector—negotiating complex upstream contracts, managing multi-stakeholder deals, and advising on regulatory frameworks—I realized one fundamental gap:
          </p>

          <p>
            Foreign companies doing business in Iran often lack access to specialized, trustworthy local guidance when it comes to high-stakes contracts and legal-economic decision-making.
            That realization led me to establish <strong>NEDA International Group of Advisors</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            NEDA was built to serve as a diagnostic and solution-focused hub—a place where complex contractual and financial challenges are identified, analyzed, and resolved with precision.
            What makes us different is not just our knowledge of legal and contractual frameworks, but our deep familiarity with how deals actually get done—on the ground, in practice, and within the unique complexities of Iran’s regulatory and business landscape.
          </p>

          <p>
            Having worked closely with major international oil and energy companies, I understand the expectations of global partners and the importance of clarity, alignment, and trust.
            At NEDA, we strive to deliver that with precision and integrity.
          </p>

          <p>
            We see every engagement not just as a transaction, but as a strategic partnership—built to last, built on understanding, and built with care.
            If contracts are the language of business, then we are your translators, navigators, and guardians of trust.
          </p>
